# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Execution Principles

Execute ALL research, analysis, and planning operations using parallel tool calls wherever technically feasible. This is non-negotiable for optimal performance.

**EXECUTION METHODOLOGY:**
1. **Parallel Task Execution**: Simultaneously execute all research, analysis, and planning tasks using parallel tool calls. Never execute sequentially what can be done in parallel.
2. **Critical Assessment Approach**: Apply rigorous, uncompromising evaluation standards. Identify genuine issues, architectural flaws, and implementation gaps without diplomatic softening. Act as a harsh critical evaluator who demands excellence.
3. **Evidence-Based Conclusions**: Every criticism must be backed by concrete evidence from codebase analysis or proven research findings, not assumptions or speculation.

**CORE PHILOSOPHY:** Simple, working solutions beat complex, broken architectures every time.

## Implementation Guidelines

When working with this Shopify Liquid documentation repository, prioritize practical, production-ready solutions that follow these principles:

1. **Theme Integration & Compatibility**: Ensure all Liquid code examples, CSS patterns, and schema configurations work seamlessly together and follow Shopify's current theme architecture. Verify that sections, blocks, and snippets integrate properly through the theme editor and render correctly on storefronts.

2. **Production-Ready & Theme Store Compliant**: Write Liquid code and CSS that can actually be deployed to live Shopify stores and passes Theme Store review standards. Use real implementations with proper performance optimization, accessibility compliance, and responsive design rather than simplified demos.

3. **Avoid Liquid Hallucination**: Only document Liquid syntax, objects, and filters that actually exist in Shopify's current API. Don't create examples with non-existent Liquid tags, fake object properties, or placeholder functionality that appears to work but doesn't exist in the Shopify ecosystem.

4. **Appropriate Complexity Level**: Choose the simplest Liquid patterns that meet merchant and developer needs. Avoid over-engineering with complex nested loops, unnecessary liquid logic, or premature CSS optimizations when straightforward section/block patterns will suffice.

5. **Clean, Maintainable Liquid**: Write clear, readable Liquid templates that theme developers can easily understand, customize, and extend. Prefer explicit, well-commented code with proper escaping and error handling over overly clever or deeply nested liquid logic.

6. **Development Efficiency Focus**: Select Liquid patterns and CSS methodologies that are both development-efficient (faster to implement and debug) and runtime-efficient (fast page loads, minimal CSS). Balance developer productivity with theme performance and merchant ease-of-use.

The goal is production-ready Liquid code and documentation that can be confidently used in live Shopify themes, maintained by theme developers, and extended without unnecessary complexity.

## Key Documentation Patterns

### Liquid Section Structure
All sections follow this pattern:
1. HTML/Liquid template code
2. Single `{% schema %}` JSON block defining:
   - Section name and settings
   - Block types (for repeatable content)
   - Presets for theme editor
   - Placement controls (`enabled_on`/`disabled_on`)

### Code Examples Philosophy
- **Copy-paste ready** - All examples are production-ready
- **Schema-driven** - Focus on section schema as the foundation
- **Performance-first** - Optimized images, minimal JS, SSR-first approach
- **Accessible** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance patterns

## Key Principles for This Codebase

### Liquid Development Standards
- **Escape all user content**: Always use `| escape` filter for text/headings
- **Guard optional settings**: Check for nil values before accessing properties
- **SSR-first approach**: Render with Liquid, use JS sparingly
- **Responsive images**: Always provide `srcset`, `sizes`, and `loading="lazy"`

### Schema Best Practices
- **Schema validation first**: Always reference `shopify-liquid-guides/schema-validation/schema-guidelines.md`
- **Range step validation**: Ensure `(max - min) / step ≤ 101`
- **Valid setting types**: Use `video` not `file` for video uploads
- **Section restrictions**: No `enabled_on` in section schemas (app blocks only)
- **Valid JSON only**: Schema must be valid JSON (no Liquid inside)
- **Clear labels**: Use descriptive labels and helpful `info` text
- **Sensible limits**: Keep `max_blocks` reasonable (≤50)
- **Logical grouping**: Group related settings together

### Performance Requirements
- **Paginate large lists**: Use `{% paginate %}` for >50 items
- **Optimize images**: Request appropriate sizes with `image_url: width:`
- **Scoped CSS/JS**: Use section-scoped styles to avoid global conflicts
- **Minimal globals**: Avoid heavy loops on global objects like `all_products`

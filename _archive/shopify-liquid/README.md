## Getting Started

If you're new to Shopify sections, start with the [Quick Start Guide](./01-quick-start.md) to build your first custom section in 6 steps.

If you're experienced with Liquid but new to sections, jump to [Section Schema Deep Dive](./02-section-schema.md) to understand the configuration system.

If you want to see working examples right away, check out [Code Examples & Patterns](./05-code-examples.md).

## Key Concepts

Think of Shopify sections like **modular building blocks** for themes:

- **Section** = The container (like a hero banner, product grid, or testimonials)
- **Blocks** = The content inside (individual slides, products, or testimonial cards)  
- **Settings** = The configuration options merchants can change
- **Schema** = The blueprint that defines how everything works

It's like having a **smart Lego system** where merchants can:
- Add or remove entire sections
- Customize the content within each section
- Rearrange blocks within sections
- Change colors, text, and images without touching code

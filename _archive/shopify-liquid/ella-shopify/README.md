# ELLA Theme Notes (Scraped Resources)

This folder stores findings and verbatim extracts about the ELLA (HaloThemes) Shopify theme to help align our blocks/sections with ELLA’s conventions.

Files
- sources.md – links and verbatim excerpts (cited)
- notes.md – concise, actionable notes for implementation

Scope
- Official docs: halosoft.gitbook.io/ella-documentation
- Demo sites: new-ella.myshopify.com (for visual reference only)

Caveat
- We avoid guessing theme internals. Where class names/utilities are needed, inspect your installed ELLA theme CSS to map our BEM classes accordingly.

**Integration:** [How it works with sections and blocks]
**Location:** `shopify-liquid-guides/code-library/snippets/[filename]`

## Implementation Details

**Shopify Dependencies:**
- [Shopify objects and properties used (product, collection, etc.)]
- [Liquid filters and tags required]
- [Theme settings or metafields needed]

**CSS Scoping Implementation:**
```liquid
{% assign unique = section.id | replace: '_', '' | downcase %}
{% style %}
  .component-{{ unique }} { /* base styles */ }
  .component__element-{{ unique }} { /* element styles */ }
{% endstyle %}
```

**Schema Configuration:**
- [Setting types and validation]
- [Block configuration and limits]
- [Preset templates for quick merchant setup]

**Theme Store Compliance:**
- [Performance requirements met]
- [Accessibility standards followed]
- [Browser compatibility ensured]

## Merchant Experience

**Theme Editor Workflow:**
1. [How merchants add and configure this feature]
2. [Setting organization and logic]
3. [Block management and customization]

**Customization Options:**
- [Visual settings (colors, spacing, layout)]
- [Content settings (text, images, CTAs)]
- [Responsive behavior controls]

## Customer Experience

**Frontend Rendering:**
- [What customers see and interact with]

- [Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)]

**Content Testing:**
- [Long product names and descriptions]
- [Missing images or empty states]
- [Multiple instances of same section]

**Theme Store Validation:**
- [Performance benchmarks]
- [Code quality standards]
- [Accessibility compliance]

## CSS Scoping Methodology

**Unique ID Generation:**
```liquid
{% assign unique = section.id | replace: '_', '' | downcase %}
```

**Class Naming Pattern:**
```css
.component-{{ unique }} { /* section styles */ }
.component__element-{{ unique }} { /* element styles */ }
.component--modifier-{{ unique }} { /* variant styles */ }
```

**Conflict Prevention:**
- [How this prevents style bleeding]
- [Component reusability across theme]
- [Integration with existing code-library patterns]

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

**Current Limitations:**
- [Shopify platform constraints]
- [Theme Store requirement conflicts]
- [Browser compatibility edge cases]

**Performance Considerations:**
